Concept of Recursion:

    Recursion is a method of solving problems where a function calls itself as a subroutine.
    It breaks down a problem into smaller instances of the same problem.

Base Case: The condition under which the recursion ends.
Recursive Case: The part of the function where the function calls itself.

Advantages:

  Simplifies code for problems that can be broken down into similar sub-problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci sequence).
  Provides a clear, readable approach for certain algorithms.

Setup
  Create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach.

Analysis
    Time Complexity:

      The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of years. Each recursive call reduces the number of years by one until it reaches zero.
  
  Optimizing the Recursive Solution:

      Memoization: Store the results of previous calculations to avoid redundant calculations. This technique can optimize the solution by reducing the number of recursive calls.
      Iterative Approach: Convert the recursive solution into an iterative one to avoid the overhead associated with recursive calls and potential stack overflow for large inputs.
